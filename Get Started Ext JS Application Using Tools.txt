Sencha Cmd v7.9.0.35
Sencha Cmd provides several categories of commands and some global switches. In
most cases, the first step is to generate an application based on a Sencha SDK
such as Ext JS or Sencha Touch:

    sencha -sdk /path/to/sdk generate app MyApp /path/to/myapp

Sencha Cmd supports Ext JS 4.1.1a and higher and Sencha Touch 2.1 and higher.

To get help on commands use the help command:

    sencha help generate app

 3. Creating Different Project Setups
Syntax

License Version Syntax:

   sencha  -sdk /path/to/ext generate app [options] name     path

-sdk tells that where is licensed sdk in your machine

Trail Version Syntax
 sencha generate app -ext   MyApp ./MyClassicApp

-ext options says that download sdk from the sencha server into local project

âœ… Classic-only Project:

  sencha generate app -ext -classic MyApp ./MyClassicApp

 -ext => force to download sdk from sencha server and keep inside your local project
 -classic -> you are creating desktop first application
 MyApp - Name of the App
./MyClassApp- FolderName where your app is created

How to run?
G:\Tungsten\extapps\MyClassicApp>sencha app watch
